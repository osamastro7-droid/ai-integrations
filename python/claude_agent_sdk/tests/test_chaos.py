"""Random agents, and Worker processes killed at random moments: the promises must hold.

Each run gives a seeded random agent (``tests/chaos/policy.py``) to the real Claude
Code engine, with Edit, Write and Bash as tool steps and a durable tool, and kills the
Worker process while an Activity runs on it (a segment or a tool step, chosen at
random), at a random moment, starting a new Worker each time. Each Worker has its own
Claude Code folders, as Workers on other machines would. Whatever happened, at the
end:

- the Workflow finished, with no failed Workflow task, and no tool step that failed
  for a reason a kill does not explain;
- no command and no edit ran twice (each has a token that shows in the files);
- every call Claude was told had worked really did;
- Claude was told a call may have run at most once per kill;
- Claude Code never checked an edit or a write again ("modified since read",
  anthropics/claude-code#99041), in any request;
- every request the model got was valid (each call with its result).

Each run takes minutes, so the test runs only when ``CHAOS_RUNS`` sets the number of
seeds per conversation mode (``CHAOS_SEED`` is the first one), for example:
``CHAOS_RUNS=50 make test PYTEST_ARGS=tests/test_chaos.py``. With ``CHAOS_LOG`` set to
a file, each passed run adds a line to it: its seed, mode, kills and outcome.
