"""What the Workflow refuses, and how a task stops, without an engine.

A segment runner that breaks its contract (no checkpoint, a splice that does not fit
the conversation, a conversation kept somewhere else) fails the task before any other
tool runs. Two agents in one Workflow keep their conversations apart. The calls of
one message finish or stop together when the Workflow is cancelled. A second task
while one runs is refused with a message, and a call to an unknown tool is an error
Claude reads. The Continue-As-New decisions follow their documented rules, for new
runs and for histories that older versions recorded.
