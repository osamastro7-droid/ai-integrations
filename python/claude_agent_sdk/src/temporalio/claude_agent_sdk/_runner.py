"""The real runner: drives the Claude Agent SDK and its bundled Claude Code engine.

How one segment works:

1. Durable tools are declared to Claude as in-process SDK MCP tools.
2. A settings-file PreToolUse command hook answers "defer" when Claude calls one, or a
   Claude Code tool in ``tool_activities``. The run stops and the SDK returns
   ``ResultMessage.deferred_tool_use``. The Workflow runs the call as a Temporal
   Activity: a durable tool's own Activity, or a tool step (``run_tool_step``).
3. The next segment resumes the session and sends the stored result as a normal
   ``tool_result`` message for that ``tool_use_id``. Claude continues and can pause
   again. In a segment, the hook keeps answering "defer" (never "allow") for these
   calls.

A tool step runs a Claude Code call that paused a segment with Brian Strauch's bounded
native call replay (from his hybrid prototype in temporalio/ai-integrations): Claude
Code resumes a private copy of the conversation that ends before the call, a stand-in
model on 127.0.0.1 (``_stand_in``) answers with the call itself, the exact ``tool_use``
block Claude sent, the hook allows exactly that call, and ``max_turns=1`` ends the turn
after it. So Claude Code runs the call in an ordinary turn and writes its own result
entry, which the step returns for an Edit or a Write (``ToolOutcome.entry``). No real
model is asked, and the command still sees the Worker's own environment.

For an Edit or a Write (``RECORDED_TOOLS``), the next segment puts that entry, or one
of the same shape (``_record``), where the call's result belongs, and Claude Code
continues the turn itself (``CONTINUE_ENV``): Claude sees the result as Claude Code
recorded it, then Claude Code's own line "Continue from where you left off.". Claude
Code does not check the call again. (Such a result sent as a new message after the
pause is checked again: Claude would be told that a file it edited in the step "has
been modified since read", anthropics/claude-code#99041.) The results of other tools
go as a message, as in step 3: Claude Code does not check them again.

Checkpoints make retries clean. After a segment, the runner reads the session back
from the session store and returns where the next segment must continue (the last
transcript entry, or the paused call's deferral marker after parallel calls) as the
segment's checkpoint; the Workflow stores it with the segment's result.

Where the conversation lives:

- By default (no ``session_store``), in the Workflow. The segment reads the committed
  transcript with a Query on its own Workflow, seeds a fresh in-memory session store
  with it (up to the checkpoint), runs, and returns what changed
  (``transcript_keep`` and ``transcript_add``); the Workflow splices it in. Every
  attempt starts from what the Workflow committed, so a retry can never build on
  an unfinished attempt, and any Worker can run any step with no shared storage.
- With a ``session_store``, in the store. Reading the checkpoint back also proves
  the turn reached the store, so a segment only commits what every Worker can
  resume. A segment that runs again (a retry after a crash or a timeout, or the
  first segment after a failed task) cannot trust what an unfinished attempt wrote,
  so it continues in a copy of the session that ends at the checkpoint
  (``fork_session_via_store``), and Claude decides again from there.

Why not "resume and let the hook allow the deferred call"? On that auto-resume path
the engine ignores a later "defer" when the resume also sends a user message, and the
SDK's resume always does (reported: anthropics/claude-code#97196).

Why a copy, and not ``resume_session_at``? Tested with Claude Code 2.1.281: resuming
at the checkpoint of a session that holds a later attempt's entries (in place or with
``fork_session``) makes the engine treat the paused call as interrupted: it answers
the call with an error placeholder and drops the delivered result. In a copy that
ends at the checkpoint, the paused call resumes normally. The same drop happens when a
user row follows the paused call (anthropics/claude-code#97358), which is why the
checkpoint after parallel calls is the deferral marker (see ``_resume_point``).

Parallel calls: the engine keeps one paused call per run, so the hook defers the first
call of a message that runs as an Activity and denies the calls after it. The segment
reports the denied durable calls (``siblings``); the Workflow runs them with the
paused one, and the next segment puts their results where the engine resumes (see
``_deliver``), so Claude sees every call of the message with its result. A denied
Claude Code call keeps its denial, and Claude calls it again. The engine starts a call
as soon as its block arrives, so with a model that takes its time between the calls
of a message, the calls after the paused one come after its pause in the session:
they move back first (see ``_blocks_first``).

        Args:
            session_store: None (the default) keeps each conversation in its
                Workflow: nothing to set up, and any Worker can run any step. Or a
                Claude Agent SDK ``SessionStore`` that every Worker can reach, to
                keep conversations there instead (``FileSessionStore`` is for tests
                and one machine). Every Worker of a task queue needs the same choice.
            cwd: Working directory of the engine. Sessions are keyed by it, so give
                every Worker the same one.
            env: Extra environment variables for the engine. The engine also
                inherits the Worker's environment.
            cli_path: Path of a Claude Code executable to use instead of the bundled one.
            extra_options: More ``ClaudeAgentOptions`` fields (for example
                ``permission_mode``, ``agents``, ``hooks``, ``setting_sources``,
                ``thinking``). ``env``, ``mcp_servers`` and ``allowed_tools`` are
                merged with the plugin's; ``system_prompt`` (a string or a preset) is
                the default for agents that set none. Options the agent or the plugin
                sets itself are refused, and so are ``extra_args`` for the same engine
                flags or for flags that approve tool calls (set ``permission_mode``
                here instead).
            one_tool_at_a_time: Ask Claude for one tool call per message. Not needed
                for durable tools: when Claude calls several at once, they all run.
            model: Default model when the agent does not set one.
            max_budget_usd: Cost cap per segment.
            warm_engines: Experimental. How many paused engines this Worker keeps
                running (0, the default: none). When the session's next segment
                runs on this Worker within ``warm_seconds``, at the same checkpoint
                and with only the result of the paused call, the result goes to the
                running engine as its next message: no new engine starts and
                resumes the session (with a local fake model, a tool round was
                about 7 times faster: 100 ms instead of 740 ms). A call of a Claude
                Code tool in ``tool_activities`` waits in the engine for its tool
                step instead of ending the turn: the step, still its own Activity,
                lets it run there when it comes to this Worker, and the turn then
                waits right after the call for the next segment (a round with an
                ``Edit``, a ``Write`` or Bash took about 0.14 to 0.24 s instead of
                1.35 to 1.97 s). Calls wait only in the permission modes ``default``
                and ``plan``, with a finite ``warm_seconds``, and one call per
                message. In any other case (another Worker, a retry, a reset, a
                longer wait) the warm engine ends, a call that waits there never
                runs there, and the step or the segment runs from the checkpoint as
                usual. Each warm engine keeps its process and memory (a few hundred
                MB); ``ClaudeAgentPlugin`` ends them when its Worker stops. No
                engine stays warm for segments with ``max_turns`` or
                ``max_budget_usd``, calls answered in one message (calls in one
                message never wait), or a runner whose ``extra_options`` has hooks,
                a permission or ``stderr`` callback, or in-process MCP servers;
                with the conversation in the Workflow, neither does the engine that
                starts it. A resumed engine runs ``PreToolUse`` hooks again for the
                call whose result it gets; a warm one does not. A warm engine keeps
                Claude Code's own notes between calls, as one Claude Code run does
                (for example, that a file changed on disk since Claude read it).
            warm_seconds: How long a paused engine stays warm.
            engine_cleanup: Whether each engine must end with this Worker process.
                ``"required"`` (the default): if the engine cannot start through its
                launcher (Linux, macOS), cannot join the Worker's job object
                (Windows), or the Worker cannot hold its lock file, the step stops
                with a retryable ``ApplicationError`` of type
                ``EngineCleanupUnavailable`` that says what to fix, before Claude
                Code runs anything (an engine can fail to join the job only after it
                started: the step then ends it at once). ``"best_effort"``: the step
                goes on with a warning, and if the Worker process dies, its engine
                finishes its current turn, built-in tools included.

        Raises:

        """Run one Claude Code tool call that paused a segment, as its own Activity.

        Brian Strauch's bounded native call replay (hybrid prototype): Claude Code
        resumes a private copy of the conversation that ends before the call (in
        memory: a session store is not written, see ``_step_context``). A local
        stand-in model answers with the call itself, the exact ``tool_use`` block
        Claude sent, so no real model is asked; the hook lets exactly that call run;
        and ``max_turns=1`` ends the turn after it. Claude Code runs the call in an
        ordinary turn, as it would have in the segment, and writes its own result
        entry. For an Edit or a Write, the step returns it with the result
        (``ToolOutcome.entry``; one of the same shape if Claude Code wrote none), and
        the next segment continues from it (see ``_place``). Tested on Claude Code
        2.1.273, 2.1.274 and 2.1.288 with Bash, Edit and Write: the tool runs once,
        with the engine's own result, and one model answer.

        No permission mode, ``allowed_tools`` or callback approves a tool in the
        step: the hook's "allow" lets the call run, and only with the input the
        segment reported (which is what an approval saw), as Claude Code is about to
        run it. If deciding fails, the hook denies the call. Only a hook that gives
        no answer at all (it could not start) leaves the call to Claude Code's own
        permission check, which refuses it unless a rule in a settings file allows
        it.

        The command still sees the Worker's own environment (see ``_step_env``), and
        a result the step already has is kept even if the engine fails afterwards,
        so the Activity is not retried for a call that ran.

        With warm engines, the call may wait for this step in its segment's engine on
        this Worker (see ``warm_engines``): for exactly that call, with the input its
        hook saw, the step lets it run there instead (``_step_in_warm``). The engine
        runs it as it would have in the segment, and the same rules hold: the hook
        records the call's start before it runs, and a step that ends first makes
        sure it never does.

        A step that fails says on which side of the call's start it failed: the hook
        writes ``allowed`` just before it lets the call run. Without that record, the
        call did not run only if the engine never got it, or the hook or Claude
        Code's permission check refused it; otherwise it may have run. So the
        Workflow can tell Claude whether the call ran; it gives the step one attempt
        unless the tool is in ``repeatable_tools``.

        Args:
            step: The call, and where its session paused.
            attempt: The Activity attempt number.

        Returns:
            What the tool returned, as Claude Code would show it to Claude.

        Raises:
            ApplicationError: Of type ``ToolCallNotRun`` if the step failed before
                Claude Code could run the call (it did not run), or
                ``ToolCallInterrupted`` if it failed after the hook let the call run
                (it may have run). Not retryable where retrying cannot help: the
                session did not pause at this call, or the hook refused it (also
                for other input than the segment reported, or when it failed). (A
                hook in ``extra_options`` that decides on the call already stopped
                the task in the segment, where the same call came first.)
