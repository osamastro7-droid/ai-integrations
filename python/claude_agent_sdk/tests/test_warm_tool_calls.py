"""Warm tool calls: a Claude Code tool call that runs as its own Activity waits in its
warm engine for its tool step.

With ``warm_engines`` on, when a segment pauses at a call of a Claude Code tool in
``tool_activities`` (Bash, Edit, Write, an MCP tool), the engine stays on the Worker
with the call waiting in its hook. The call's tool step, still its own Activity, lets
it run there when it comes to the same Worker; the turn then waits right after the
call for the next segment. Anything else (another Worker, a retry, a wait longer than
``warm_seconds``, a stopped or killed Worker) ends the warm engine: the call never
runs there, and the step or the next segment runs as without warm engines.

The tests run the real Claude Code engine with the local fake model, in real Workflows,
and compare each warm run with the same run cold: the same files, each command and
edit once, the same model requests, and the same total cost. Requests are compared
with ids and paths left out, and without the line Claude Code adds when it continues
a turn by itself ("Continue from where you left off."): a new engine that continues
after a tool step's result adds it, an engine that never stopped does not. Claude
Code's own notes (``NOTES``, ``RESULT_NOTES``) and bash's job control warning
(``JOB_CONTROL``) are left out too.
