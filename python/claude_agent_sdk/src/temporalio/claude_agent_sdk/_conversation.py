"""The conversation the Workflow holds: the Query that serves it, and the step side.

Without a session store, the Claude session's transcript lives in the Workflow, like
the conversation of the other AI integrations in this repository. A segment reads the
committed transcript with a Query on its own Workflow (so the transcript is not
copied into every step's input, and the history grows with what each step adds, not
with the whole conversation), seeds an in-memory session store with it, and returns
what it changed. Every attempt starts from the committed transcript, so nothing a
failed attempt wrote can reach Claude, and any Worker can run any step.

With External Storage, a Query result over its threshold goes to the store, at every
step that reads it. So pages stay under the threshold, and a page holds nothing but
its entries: an entry too large for a page of its own is the same payload at every
read, which a content-addressed store (such as Temporal's S3 driver) keeps once.
